### Step 2: Write something in Markdown

Write something else in this basic paragraph
**Everyone can structure documents with Markdown.**   _Most people love_ markdown.  ~~Some people are less enthusiastic~~. Add your own text in this paragraph.^[Inlines notes don't have to pick an identifier. ]  You can manage footnotes, citations, and bibliographies.  Learn more about citations and bibliographies in the Cheatsheet `(RStudio IDE > Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown cheat sheet)`^[ [Browse all the RStudio Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) ] There is more than one kind of markup for footnotes.  I like the above style.  However, you can also do use this style.[^footnote]

[^footnote]: Test, [Link](https://google.com).

- [x] **Bold**
- [ ] *Italic*
- [ ] Super^script^
- [ ] Sub~script~
- [ ] ~~Strikethrough~~
